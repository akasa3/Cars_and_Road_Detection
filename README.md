# Cars and Road detection using Mask RCNN

This is a reproduction of my intern task, which is 'Instance Segmentation of cars and road using Mask R-CNN'.

Most of core algorithm code is based on [Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).

## Dataset and Annotation

I used [Google Street View dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/GMCP_Geolocalization/), and annotated by using [VGG Image Annotator](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/).

## Setup and Run
How to setup and run is same as [Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).
